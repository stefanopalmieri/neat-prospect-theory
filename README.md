## NEAT Prospect Theory

The purpose of this repo is to empirically validate the Risk Sensitive Optimal Foraging Theory presented by Rose Mcdermott et al in `On the Evolutionary Origin of Prospect Theory Preferences`. The experiment performed in the notebook uses the Neuroevolution of Augmenting Topologies (NEAT) algorithm to simulate the evolution of a population that is evaluated on the foraging decision task formulated by Mcdermott et al.

## Motivation and Potential Use Cases

Understanding the origins of the Psychological Value Function defined by Kahneman and Tservsky could have potential value in aligning human and AI in scenarious dealing with risk.

## Analysis

The experiment does not seem conclusive. It does not appear that the populate evolves to increase fitness on the task. The winning phenotype does not seem to create a Neural Network that operates in such a way to maximize survivability. This is possibly due to a problem with the experiment setup or with the evaluation function. Please make a pull request if you find a potential issue.
